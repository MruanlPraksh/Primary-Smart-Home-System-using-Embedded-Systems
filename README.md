# Primary-Smart-Home-System-using-Embedded-Systems

Advancements in Smart Home technologies have made Home automation a reality. Home automation serves the key aspect of providing assistance to the elderly and disabled individuals using intelligent and interconnected devices which include various sensors and actuators for the purpose of monitoring medical emergencies like falls or seizures. This project is concerned with the design and development of a primary smart home system for automatic heating and lighting control, and fall detection with provisions to access environmental parameter readings like temperature, ambient light levels, etc., by utilizing an STM32 microcontroller. The designing, compiling and debugging of the required system is executed in Mbed compiler which is a cloud based platform for STM32 Nuleo-64 Development Board with STM32F303RE MCU. The embedded project was a success, in that the designed system met the specifications given, however there is significant room for improvement for the system by using technologies like Internet of Things (IoT).

The project code is published in mbed [here](https://os.mbed.com/users/MPGavali/code/Design-and-Development-of-a-Primary-Smar/)

The `terminal` to view the result from the STM32F303RE ARM board is also also attached in this repository to see the output results on windows platform.
